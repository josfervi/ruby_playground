ITERATION

every line of code you don't have to write is one fewer to debug

USE Array#each instead of for:
For boring reasons, for is not recommended for use.
You'll see plenty of Python code use for this way, but satisfy yourself with using #each
#
Boring reason: the iterator variable
(i.e. item in the above for loop construct example)
is still bound after exiting the loop.
This doesn't happen with each.


instead of
  (1..10).to_a.reverse.each {|i| puts i}
use
  10.downto(1).each {|i| puts i}

unclear, abstract index names are a major source of confusion and bugs.
Here names like num1 and num2 would make things clearer.

Avoid deep nesting. Nested code should be split out into methods.
Two levels deep is usually okay, more is almost always bad.
